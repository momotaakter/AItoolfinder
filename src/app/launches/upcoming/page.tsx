Skwad is a privacy-first money management tool designed to assist users in understanding and tracking their spending. The unique proposition of Skwad is that it helps users maintain financial clarity without the need to link or share their bank login details with a third-party application. Instead, users receive a dedicated Skwad email address where they can direct spending alerts from their banks or credit card providers which are then quickly converted into categorized transactions. Skwad facilitates the uploading of old transactions for a comprehensive financial overview. Notably, Skwad alerts users about out-of-place transactions or changes in spending patterns, helping in the early identification and mitigation of financial risks. Another feature is the tracking of bills and subscriptions, with provided notifications for upcoming payments and fee changes. The Skwad app allows the sharing of specific transactions with a trusted group (Skwad) and offers functionalities such as spend calendar, transaction enhancement with receipts, synchronization to Google Sheets, and transaction splitting. In terms of security and privacy, only transaction information is accessed by Skwad, with no requirement or exposure of sensitive bank details.
